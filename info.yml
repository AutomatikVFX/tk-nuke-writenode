    write_nodes:
        type: list
        description: "A list of dictionaries in which you define the Tank write nodes that
                     are supported in this configuration. Each dictionary entry needs to have
                     the following keys: name - a descriptive name for this node. file_type -
                     the file type to use for the renders (exr, cin, dpx etc). This will be
                     passed to the Nuke write node when rendering. settings - configuration
                     settings for the given file type, as a dictionary. This too will be
                     passed to the write node when rendering. Lastly, you need two entries
                     named render_template and publish_template
                     - these control the locations where data is written to at various stages
                     of the workflow. These templates need to include the fields
                     name and version, and can optionally include the fields width, height
                     (which reflect the image resolution of the render) and channel (which
                     differenciates different write nodes). If you are doing stereo
                     rendering and want to use Nuke's %V flag, include an eye field.
                     This will be replaced by %V in the paths when the tank write node
                     computes them."
